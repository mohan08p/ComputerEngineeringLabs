# Machine Learning

Among the different types of ML tasks, a crucial distinction is drawn between supervised and unsupervised learning:

**Supervised machine learning**: The program is “trained” on a pre-defined set of “training examples”, which then facilitate its ability to reach an accurate conclusion when given new data.
**Unsupervised machine learning**: The program is given a bunch of data and must find patterns and relationships therein.
